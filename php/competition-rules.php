                        1 Point for predicting the correct result, i.e. a home win (H), an away win (A), a draw (D).<br>

                        In the knockout stages, you will still be awarded points, for predicting the correct result (H/A/D) or predicting the correct score, 
                        even if, you do not manage to correctly predict the correct home team and the correct away team for the match.
                        These points are awarded as a way to allow everyone to maintain an interest in the later stages of the tournament even if their predictions do not exactly match the actual outcomes.<br>

                        <p>For each match in the knockout stages, bonus points are awarded for predicting the correct teams. For example, 
                        based on your predictions in the group stages, you predict Netherlands would win group A and the USA would be runners up in Group B.
                        If both teams qualify as you predicted, then you would get bonus points (see below) for correctly predicting the correct home team (Netherlands) and the correct away team (USA).</p><br>
